## Some attempts to use Markdown markup that did not work:

% Not all markdown versions support all markup syntax you can find. E.g. this % mark does nothing for me in VS Code that has the Markdown PDF installed. 

Also this footnote thing is not working here
Let's do some footnotes[^note]
Let's do second footnote[^note]

> Another nice quote (this part works)

That quote was from a nice guy. [@Nice Guy]. This line syntax doesn't work.
